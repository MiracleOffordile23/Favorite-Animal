      <h1>My Favorite Animal</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      Among all the animals, the <b>Eagel</b> stands out as my favorite because
      of it's strength, beauty, and courage. With it's powerful wing, it can fly
      higher than other birds, making it a true symbol of freedom. What
      fascinates me most is its incredible eyesight, which allows it to spot
      prey from miles away. The <b>Eagel</b> also represen determination as it
      never give up easily and also rises above <em>challenges</em>. Its ability
      to soar confidently in the sky inspires me to aim high in life which is
      why the <b>Eagle</b> is my favorite animal.    </p>
